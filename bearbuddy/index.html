<p class="aboutusinfo"> Bear Buddy is a web application that helps people, particularly teenagers, improve their well-being. In 2020, 21% of adults were diagnosed with mental illness (52.9 million people). This equates to one in every five adults. In 2020, 5.6 percent of adults were diagnosed with serious mental illness (14.2 million people). This equates to one in every twenty adults. We encourage people to open up at Bear Buddy. The goal is to #BreakTheStigma. Our entertaining quizzes and friendly chatbots would assist users in refreshing their minds. Individuals who are suffering are encouraged to see that there is hope for their recovery, that they are more than their diagnosis, and that they have nothing to be ashamed of.</p>
