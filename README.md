## Inspiration
For me, high school was a challenging time. Everything took a toll on my mental health- the increased stress of schoolwork and the expectation to perform well in almost every class. Finding time for myself was extremely difficult due to sleep deprivation and anxiety, and it posed significant barriers to achieving my goals. Bear Buddy was created for students like myself, for those who needed an additional tiny voice in their head encouraging them to keep going.

## What it does
At Bear Buddy we encourage everyone to open up through our:
- BuzzFeed type quizzes: Our quizzes are a lot of fun, and they can help you relax. It helps those who are less expressive or introverted in identifying themselves and letting others know who they are.
- Self-Introspection To-Do List: Bear Buddy's to-do list promotes mindfulness. Mindfulness helps in the control of emotions, as well as the reduction of stress, anxiety, and depression. It also improves our ability to concentrate.
- Affirmation Quote Generator: This tool will generate a positive quote for you to use to affirm and build yourself up.
- Resources: On our Resources page, you'll find a list of organizations dedicated to promoting mental health and eliminating the stigma associated with it. The user will be taken to the respective organization's resources page by clicking on their logos.

## How I built it
The whole website was mainly built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript. The logos and images were created with the help of Canva. 

## Challenges I ran into
Aligning all of the website's components to make it look aesthetically pleasing was a difficult task. It was a little hard to build the To-Do list. It was also challenging to make the website mobile-friendly. Furthermore, I only had a limited amount of time to design this full website by myself; it's not perfect, but I'm glad I was able to finish it!

## Accomplishments that I am proud of
I'm very proud to have brainstormed and coded this website by myself in such a short period of time. My website has the potential to actually help people and that's amazing! 

## What I learned
I learned how to use JavaScript to improve the usability and appearance of websites. I also had the opportunity to play around with Python on the backend. Despite the fact that I was unable to execute it this time due to the lack of time, I learned a lot and will definitely implement it to my next project

## What's next for Bear Buddy?
There will be more exciting developments in the near future. I want to make Bear Buddy a non-profit organization and set up numerous social media profiles to promote our objective (#BreakTheStigma). I plan to complete and launch the website by the end of 2022. In addition, I intend to offer free therapy sessions and resources to teenagers.
